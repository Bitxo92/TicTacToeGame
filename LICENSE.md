Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Definitions

This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the author or other copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program," below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification.") Each licensee is addressed as "you."

 1. You may copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Program, and you may permit others to do so.

2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

3. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and you must provide a copy of this License along with the Program.

4. You may not use the name of the copyright holder or any other names provided by the copyright holder for publicity or to assert or imply endorsement of your modified version.

5. There are no restrictions on the use of the Program; however, if you distribute the Program or a derivative work, you must do so under the terms of this License.

6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

7. If you distribute copies of the Program or derivative works, you must do so under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Program or derivative work that you distribute.

8. This License gives no permission to the author or copyright holder to impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

9. If you copy or distribute the Program, or a work based on the Program, you must accompany it with a copy of this License.

10. There is no warranty for the Program, and there is no obligation for the author to provide support or updates.

11. If you wish to use this Program in a way that is not allowed by this License, you must seek permission from the copyright holder.

12. Each time you redistribute the Program, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original author to copy, distribute, or modify the Program subject to these terms.

13. This License is intended to ensure that every user has the freedom to share and change all versions of a program.

14. The GNU General Public License is designed to make sure that the software is free for all its users.

15. If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this License shall remain in full force and effect.

16. This License shall be governed by the laws of the state of [your state], and any disputes arising under this License shall be resolved in the courts of [your state].

17. When a user uses the software, they agree to the terms of this license.
